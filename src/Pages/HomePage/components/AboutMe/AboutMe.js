            <Explain>
                I am a Computer Science student in SabancÄ± University at junior level. My main aim is start my own game company; therefore,
                I am trying to improve myself on game development. However, I also like working with web-development and also mobile development, so while
                improving myself on game development, I also improve myself on these majors too.
